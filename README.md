# Kumquats

A word game where you place letters to create intersecting words as quickly as possible.

Built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), and runs on Android, iOS, web, macOS, Linux, and probably Windows.

If you're building on Android, you'll need to specify the "std" [build flavor](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/flavors). There's also an "fdroid" flavor, which is only for building the release for F-Droid.
